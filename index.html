                            I was born in the Yarmouk camp neighborhood and then moved to live in Qudsaya and studied primary school at Qudsaya First School, and received the Al-Basel Certificate for Outstanding Students in the Primary School, I learned to swim at the age of seven and won two gold medals in 2007 and 2008.

                            I studied middle school at the Boys’ School in Qudsaya, and when I was in the eighth grade, the war began in Syria, and after obtaining a basic education certificate, I moved from Qudsaya and started working in a fast food restaurant to help my family financially.

                            I had to stop my studies because of work, and then I returned at the age of eighteen and applied for the secondary certificate exam and passed it with an average of 88%, which enabled me to enter the Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering / Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering and graduated after five years with a very good grade.

                            In order to achieve my projects that I planned with Loujain, we must travel sooner or later because the economic situation in Syria is the biggest obstacle in the face of any project we planned or might be planning in the future <br><strong>"Erbil is a station, not a destination"</strong><br>Erbil was the first choice for ease of travel to and from it in the future, and from there I will go with Lujain to the rest of the countries that we dream of visiting, in addition to the fact that the standard of living there is much better than the standard of living in Syria.
